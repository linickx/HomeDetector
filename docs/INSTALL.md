# Installation Instructions

By installing Home Detector, and performing no configuration at all you will have successfully deployed a Telnet honeypot onto your network which will alert when a threat tries to log in. For more advanced detections see [Docs.md](https://github.com/linickx/ha-addons/blob/main/homedetector/DOCS.md)

## Install via Add-on Store (with custom repository)

Home Detector can be installed via Home Assistant's Add-on Store, to update your store either use the one-click or manually add the repository.

## Any Other Business

ðŸš¨ Warning: Home Detector is only support on 64bit processors, i.e. x86_64 (`amd64`) or ARM64 (`aarch64`) this is due to modern cryptography libraries (_used by Open Canary_) requiring rust which is not provided in the base python/alpine 32bit docker images. For Raspberry Pi users, that means Pi 4 or newer.
