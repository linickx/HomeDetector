## Bug Fixes

If you find a bug please let me know and describe the steps to reproduce, enable Debug-Mode to gather additional logging.

## New Features

I'm open to new ideas, fire away! Please keep in mind, the goal of the project is Intrusion Detection *at home* so new features need to be applicable to home use.

This is a personal project, no financial reward can or will be offered for finding security issues, please email `linickx at-at gmail dotty-dot com` with your findings.
